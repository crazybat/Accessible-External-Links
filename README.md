Accessible-External-Links
=========================

An accessible way of indicating external links, as well as announcing a new window. 

<p>Testing external links up in here. Actually, it all started with a question from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GlendaWH/status/90531756826042368" rel="external">Glenda</a> about the accessibility of using CSS to announce a new window, based on an <a href="http://ht.ly/5BRcx" rel="external">external link example</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SteveBuell" rel="external">Steve</a> was there to help. The rest is history ;)</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="http://www.doitmyselfblog.com/who-is-glenda-watson-hyatt-glendawh/" rel="external">Glenda</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SteveBuell" rel="external">Steve</a> for your help on this. Just when I thought I knew everything :)</p>
